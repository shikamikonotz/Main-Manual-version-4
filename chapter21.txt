#Chapter 21: Preservation of Specimens

See the Shika Express Biology manual for information regarding collection and preservation of particular specimens covered in the O-level syllabus.

##21.1 Dead Specimens

- Mosses and lichens: Wrap in paper or keep in a closed container.
- Plants and parts thereof: hang in the sun until dry. Alternatively, press the plants using absorbent material and a stack of books.
- Insects: Leave exposed to air but out of reach by other insects until bacteria eat everything except the exoskeleton. If you want to preserve the soft tissue, store under methylated spirits.
- Fish, worms, amphibians, and reptiles: Store in methylated spirits (will makes specimens brittle) or a 10% formaldehyde solution (more poisonous and more expensive).
- Parts of mammals (e.g. pig eyes, bovine reproductive organs): store in 10% formaldehyde solution. 

##21.2 Skeletons
Skin the animal and remove as much meat as possible. Bury the bones for several months. Exhume and assemble with wire and superglue.

##21.3 Living Specimens

Be creative! Figure out what the animal will eat, who will feed it, what it will drink, where it can hide, how it can be observed, etc.
