#Chapter 2: Specific Technical Needs of a School Laboratory

Laboratories facilitate hands-on investigation of various phenomena. Every syllabus requires different topics for study, but a core of topics provide a good foundation for each subject.

##4.1 Basic Biology Laboratory

A basic biology laboratory should allow the following investigations:

- Collection, shelter, and observation of living specimens (plant, insect, fish, reptile, mammal)
- Bacterial and fungal cultures
- Preservation and dissection of dead specimens (plant, insect, fish, reptile, mammal; both whole and parts thereof)
- Assembly and observation of miniature ecosystems
- Low power microscopy
- Diffusion and osmosis
- Chemical tests of basic biological molecules (“biochemical tests” / “food tests”)
- Chemical analysis of the products of animal and plant respiration
- Non-invasive investigation of human systems (nervous, sensory, circulatory, muscular, parts of the digestive)

Key materials are:

- Containers, bottles, tubes, super glue
- Plants, insects, fish, (safe) reptiles, and small mammals
- Sugar, starch, protein source, fertilizer, salt, food coloring
- Chemicals for preservation of specimens
- Scalpels and pins
- Low power microscopes (water drop microscopes, locally assembled) - Reagents for biochemical tests
- Reagents for gas identification
- Stopwatches
- Heat sources

## 4.2 Basic Chemistry Laboratory

A basic chemistry laboratory should allow for the following investigations:

- Distinguishing compounds from mixtures, preparing chemical compounds, separating mixtures
- Changes in the state of matter (melting/freezing, evaporation/condensation, sublimation/deposition, dissolution/crystallization)
- Comparison of metals and non-metals
- Comparison of covalent and ionic (electrovalent) compounds
- Observing various elements and compounds and their reactivity with air, water, acids and bases
- Acid/base, oxidation/reduction, and precipitation reactions
- Energy changes from chemical reactions (thermochemistry, energetics)
- Factors affecting the rates of chemical reactions (chemical kinetics)
- Properties of gases (gas laws)
- Preparation of gases (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide)
- Electrochemical experiments (conductivity, electrolysis, electroplating, voltage generation)
- Volumetric analysis (titration)
- Identification of unknown salts (“qualitative analysis”)
- Very basic organic reactions (e.g. preparation of ethanol by fermentation, oxidation of ethanol to ethanal)

Key materials are:

- Containers, bottles, tubes, balloons
- Tools for measuring volume (calibrated plastic water bottles, plastic syringes)
- Low cost balance (digital)
- Heat sources and open non-luminous flames
- Stopwatches
- Power supplies (e.g. batteries) and wires
- Wide variety of chemicals including metallic elements, non-metallic elements, solid covalent com- pounds, salts, acids, bases, redox reagents, indicators, and many chemicals for specific kinds of reactions

- Temperature, heat capacity, and heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation)
- Waves (including water and sound)
- Optical experiments (reflection, refraction, diffraction)
- Electromagnetic experiments (conductivity, magnetic field lines, induction, motors, electrical generation)
- Simple circuits (including resistors, capacitors, and switches) 

Key materials are:

- A low cost balance (digital)
- Tools for measuring volume
- Containers, misc. objects, bottles, etc. 
- Stopwatches
