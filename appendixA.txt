#Appendix A: Sources of Laboratory Equipment

In order to gain a thorough understanding of science, students must be able to make a connection between classroom learning and the outside world. The following is a list of locally available materials which may be used to substitute conventional materials and apparatus for various activities. These materials have the following advantages:

- They are readily available in the village or a nearby town;
- They are cheaper than conventional materials;
- They may safely substitute the conventional materials without fear of losing accuracy or understanding;
- They help students to draw a connection between science education and the world around them.

Imagination and innovativeness is encouraged on the part of the student and teacher to find other suitable local substitutions.

Below are common apparatus you might order from a laboratory supply company, and comments about which have good if not superior alternatives available in villages and towns.

Glass blocks from a lab supply company are generally 15 mm thick. 8 mm and 10 mm glass is relatively common in towns. 12 mm and thicker glass exists though is even more difficult to find. Stack several pieces of thinner glass together and turn them on their edge.

##A.22 Gloves 

###A.22.1 Latex gloves
**Use:** First aid, when one has open cuts on hands, handling specimens. They are worthless to the chemist because they make the hands less agile and give the user a false sense of security.
**Safety:** Concentrated acids and organic chemicals burn straight through latex.

###A.22.2 Thick gloves
**Use:** For working with organic solvents. Remember that the most dangerous organic solvents (benzene, carbon tetrachloride) should never be used in a school, with or without gloves.
**Materials:** Thick rubber gloves from village industry supply companies and some hardware stores
**Safety:** In general, avoid using chemicals that would make you want to wear gloves.

##A.23 Goggles
**Use:** Handling concentrated acids
**Materials:** 1.5 L plastic water bottles, cardboard, sunglasses
**Procedure:** Cut a strip of plastic from a water bottle. Attach around your head with string or by using stiff cardboard as a frame. Goggles do not need to be impact resistant – they just need to stand between hazardous chemicals and your eyes.

![gogglesjpg.txt](images/gogglesjpg.txt)

##A.24 Heat Sources
**Use:** Heating substances
**Materials:** Candles, kerosene stoves, charcoal burners, Motopoa (alcohol infused heavy oil), butane lighters, spirit burners, metal can, bottle caps
Motopoa provides the best compromise heat source - it is the easiest to use and safest heat source with locally available burners. 
**Procedure:** Cut a metal can in half or use a bottle cap and add a small amount of Motopoa.
**Safety:** Always have available fire-fighting equipment that you know how to use. Remember that to put out a Bunsen burner safely, you need to turn off the gas.

![heat-sources.jpg](images/heat-sources.jpg)

![heat-sources-2.jpg](images/heat-sources-2.jpg)

###A.24.1 Heating Solutions

The ideal heat source has a high heat rate (joules transferred per second), little smoke, and cheap fuel, i.e. Motopoa. A charcoal stove satisfies all of those but takes time to light and requires relatively frequent re-fueling. Kerosene stoves have excellent heat rates but are smoky. 

###A.24.2 Heating Solids
The ideal heat source has a high temperature and no smoke, i.e. a Bunsen burner. For heating small objects for a short time (no more than 10-20 seconds), a butane lighter provides a very high temperature. Motopoa will provide a flame of satisfactory temperature for as long as necessary.

###A.24.3 Flame Tests
The ideal heat source has a high temperature and produces a non-luminous flame, i.e. a Bunsen burner. Motopoa is next best – hot and non-luminous. Spirit burners produce a non-luminous flame at much greater cost, unless methylated spirits are used as fuel in which case the flame is much cooler. A butane lighter produces a very hot flame of sufficient size and time for flame tests although the non-luminous region is small. Kerosene stoves will work for some salts.

##A.25 Indicators
**Use:** Determine presence of acid or base, determine pH
**Materials:** Rosella leaves, hot water, bottle
**Procedure:** Place some coloured leaves into a bottle of warm water to extract the colour. Use a straw to drop onto solutions or prepare indicator paper by dipping thing strips into the coloured solution. Rosella turns red for acids and greenish blue for bases.

![making-indicatorsjpg.txt](images/making-indicatorsjpg.txt)

##A.26 Iron Filings
**Use:** To map magnetic fields
**Materials:** Steel wool / Iron wool used for cleaning pots
**Procedure:** Rub some steel wool between your thumb and fingers. The small pieces that fall are iron filings. Collect them in a matchbox or other container to use again.

##A.27 Masses
See Weights (p. 219).

##A.28 Measuring Cylinder
**Use:** Measuring volume
**Materials:** Plastic bottles of different sizes, syringes (10 mL - 50 mL), fluorescent light tubes, marker pen, ruler, bucket of water
**Procedure:** Using the syringe, transfer a known volume of water from the bucket to the empty bottle. Use the marker pen to mark the level of water on the bottle. Repeat for a range of volumes, using a ruler to complete the scale.

![meas-cyljpg.txt](images/meas-cyljpg.txt)

##A.29 Metre Rule
**Use:** Measuring length
**Materials:** Slabs of wood, ceiling board, permanent pen
**Procedure:** Buy one, take it and a permanent pen to a carpenter, and leave with twenty. Measure each new one to the original rule to prevent compounding errors.

**Use:** Microscope, Laws of Reflection
**Materials:** piece of thin glass, kibatari, super glue, small wooden blocks
**Optional:** Small pieces of mirror glass are cheap or free at a glass cutter’s shop
**Procedure:** Light the kibatari so that it creates a lot of smoke. Pass one side of the glass repeatedly over the kibatari until that side is totally black. The other side acts as a mirror. Super glue to small wooden blocks to stand upright.

###A.31.2 Curved Mirrors
**Use:** Curved mirror practicals
**Materials:** Spoons

**Safety:** Avoid standard pipettes to eliminate danger of mouth pipetting.

##A.36 Pulleys
**Use:** Simple machines
**Materials:** Bent nail, twisted wire, thread reel, water bottle, string, coat hanger

![pulleys.jpg](images/pulleys.jpg)

##A.37 Resistors
**Use:** Electrical components
**Materials:** Old radios, circuit boards, soldering iron
**Procedure:** Remove resistors from old radios and circuit boards by melting the solder with a soldering iron or a stiff wire heated by a charcoal stove. If you need to know the ohms, the resistors tell you. Each has four strips (five if there is a quality band) and should be read with the silver or gold strip for tolerance on the right. Each color corresponds to a number:

black = 0, yellow = 4, violet = 7, brown = 1, green = 5, gray = 8, red = 2, blue = 6, white = 9, orange = 3

and additionally for the third stripe: 

gold = -1, silver = -2

The first two numbers should be taken as a two digit number, so green-violet would be 57, red-black 20, etc. The third number should be taken as the power of ten (a 10n term), so red-orange-yellow would be 23 × 104 = 230000, red-brown-black would be 21 × 100 = 21 and blue-gray-silver would be 68 × 10−2 = 0.68. The unit is always ohms. The fourth and possibly fifth bands may be ignored.

##A.38 Retort Stand

**Materials:** Stainless steel spoons
**Procedure:** Use the handle end to remove salts from containers.
**Safety:** Clean all metal tools promptly after using with hydroxide, potassium manganate (VII), or manganese (IV) oxide. If the spoon corrodes, scrape with another spoon or steel wool.

![spatulajpg.txt](images/spatulajpg.txt)

##A.43 Spring Balance
**Use:** To measure force applied on an object
**Materials:** Strip of cardboard, rubber band, 2 paper clips, staple pin, pen
**Procedure:** Cut a rubber band and fix one end to the top of a cardboard strip using a staple pin. (A stronger rubber band allows for a greater range of forces to measure.) Attach one paper clip near the top as a pointer. Attach the other paper clip as a hook at the bottom of the rubber band. Calibrate the spring balance using known masses. Write the equivalent force in Newtons on the cardboard. (A 1 g mass has a weight of 0.01 N, 100 g has a weight of 1 N, etc.)
